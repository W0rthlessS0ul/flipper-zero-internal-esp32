## 🚀 What Will This Bring Me?
The ESP32 is a module that operates with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. When connected to the Flipper Zero, it enables various attacks such as deauthentication, handshake capturing, and many other possibilities.

## 🛠️ What Types of Boards Would Be Suitable?
| Board Type          | Compatibility |
|---------------------|---------------|
| esp32-wroom-32      | ✅            |
| esp8266             | ➕➖          |
| esp32-C3 supermini  | ❌           |

*Note: If you're using the ESP8266, you won't be able to access certain features, such as handshake capture.*

## 🧑‍🔧 Let's Get Started with Soldering!
However, please remember that the author bears no responsibility for any potentially damaged boards; you undertake all actions at your own risk!

1. To start, you need to desolder the metal cover from your ESP32 (or ESP8266).  
   ![esp32 metal cover](esp32_cover.png)

2. Now, open the Flipper Zero and disassemble it down to the main board with the display and buttons. For a detailed example of how to do this, refer to the article provided: [article](https://habr.com/ru/articles/599791/)

3. Now, arrange the ESP32 and the 5V to 3.3V converter on the motherboard.

4. Now, please solder the ESP32 converter to the Flipper Zero as shown.

| esp32 | flipper |
|-------|---------|
|  TX   |  RX     |
|  RX   |  TX     |

| esp32 | converter |
|-------|-----------|
|3.3V   |Vo         |
|GND    |GND        |

| flipper | converter |
|---------|-----------|
|GND      |GND        |
|5V       |Vi         |

5. Now, we need to connect GPIO 0 to GND using tweezers or a wire on the ESP32. Then, switch to the ESP32 flasher on the Flipper and select the Marauder firmware to install.

6. Now, assemble the Flipper and, by entering the [ESP32]WiFi Marauder, you will be able to utilize the ESP32.
